    <p>The Drake is a the most common type of creature we think of when we think of dragons.They are the most dangers type of dragon to run across.These proud beasts have very good eyesight and half their time in the air and half running on ground like a horse.</p>
    <p>These creatures are not aggassive on their own but will attack if they see someone they like, this is unfortunately, anything shinny like gold or silver</p>
    <p class="azure-text">These tihngs include but are not limited to</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Golden rings</li>
      <li>golden neckless

        <li>bright yellow paint</li>
        <li> silver plates</li>
      <li>Any kind of precious jewel</li>
    </ul>

    <ol class="ncb boxcol">
      <li>Running at it with a sword</li>
      <li>Trying to pet it</li>
      <li> Trying to steal any gold you see around it</li>
      <li>yelling at it</li>
    </ol>
    <p id="elel">Dispite the risks, riding drakes have becoming a popular pastime with several song being written about this activity.However we do caution you dear reader not to try this as while the few success are sung about, the likelyhood of death is usually 4 out of 6 times.</p>

<p>The one odd one out.</p>
  <p>This dragon has no armms and no legs, they dont even have wings most of the time which is why they are called wyrms, you may notice that it sounds very close to the word worm but don't be fooled. They breath fire and have fang just as large as anything you find in a drake mouth. The good thing is that they are non-aggrissve as will usually avoid people, not much is known about them as the avoid people </p>
