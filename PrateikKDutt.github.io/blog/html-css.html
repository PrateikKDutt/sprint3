      <h1> Margin,Border and Padding</h1>
      <p>When making a wedsite we run into the terms  "Margin, Border and Padding" but are these?
        To under these concepts fully please first understand that everything in CSS is done insie a box. These three funcution are what are used to manipulate those boxs. They control the space around and within those boxs.
        </p>
<p> To show you this: here is an empty box</p>
      <div class="box-1">
</div>
 <h2> The Border</h2>
<p>Now the first and easier conpect to understand is the border, it is what it sounds like. A border is the outline or edge of the "box", anotherway to think of it is the space inbetween the margins and padding. To help should this here is the border thickened and hightlighted in blue.</p>

<div class="box-2"></div>
<h2>The Padding</h2>

<p>The padding is a little more tricky than the border but not ny much. The padding is the space inside the box that is between the contents and the border,To help show you this lets fill the box with red and add some content.</p>
<div class="box-3 w-text">The backer loves to bake bread early in the morning for all the hunger hamters huddling at home.</div>
  <p>Now you will notice that the text is crammed togather, there is not alot of space at all, that is becasue the padding in this box as been set to 0, let changed that and add some for in the box below</p>
  
  <div class="box-32 w-text">The backer loves to bake bread early in the morning for all the hunger hamters huddling at home</div>  
<p> Now you can see a gap between the text and the boarder, not alot but more than before, this is the padding. Remember it is the apce between the context (text in this case) and the border, the </p>

<p>Here is the boarder is thicked in blue to see better, you will see that while the border is thicker the conent is still the same distance, this is the tihng to remember about padding: It is the space of the content between the conent and the border.</p>
<div class="box-33 w-text">The backer loves to bake bread early in the morning for all the hunger hamters huddling at home.</div>
<h2>Margin</h2>
<p>While margins sound sounds simialar to borders and serve a simialar funcution the different between them is that The margin is the space between the boarder and page. Remember that the everything on html is in a box, thing of margin as a the wedpage and the box border.</p>
<div id=box5></div>
<p>The red box is all the way on the left because I put the margin on the right, pushing it to the left. I have wrote that there should be space between the edge (border) of the box and the edge of the wedpage, I have however put so much space that the box was pushed all the way to the left.</p>
<p>Now when we do this in reverse (add margin to the left) the box will go to the right. </p>
<div id="box6"></div>
<p>However, when we add space on both side we can the box in the center</p>
<div id="box7"></div>
