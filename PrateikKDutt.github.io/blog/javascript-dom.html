      <h1>My thoughts on JAVA and the DOM</h1>
      <p>Control flow is how was your computer runs code from top to bottom, It is in so I like to think of it the logic of your computer how it reads.</p>
      <p>This time studying has not been easy and most of the concets are full of things I donâ€™t completely understand myself but the best way I like to think of it as in a comparison to a painting HTML is the canvas CSS is the paint but Java and the Dom are The pigment and the frame they are the things which control the logic of the website really they control help bring in the functions the buttons and help navigate CSS in HTML together</p>
      <p>Functions are the small rules that guides JavaScript along the way so function a bit like the ID code for HTML, However the rules for JAVA I found our vastly more complex</p>
      <p>The best way I can describe the dawn is by its name the  dominant document. It is the box that holds everything together it is what driver runs through with CSS and HTML as well run through you can control any one of HTML or CSS functions through through the DOM.</p>
