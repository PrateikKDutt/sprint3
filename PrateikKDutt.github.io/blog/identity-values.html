        <h1>Personal Values and Ethics</h1>
        <h2 class="s-text">A lost Wallet</h2>
        <p class="box mar"> One of my values is to try to do a good thing when you can and to try to be sure it is a good thing that is being done. When I was a child I lost my favorite toy truck because I felt it on the sidewalk where I was playing. I still remeber how upset I was that it was gone. Last year I had lost my dirver forklift licence and was worried i'd have to pay for another one when I gota message from a women who had found it and asked me how to return it, was thrilled., last year while I was working I was near a Z station re-filling the company truck when I saw a black wallet in the middle of the road, I ran over and grabbed it; to my suprise it held $40 along with credit card and other personal information. While I knew I could hand the wallet into the police and they could hold onto it I could also see if I could return it myself. I figured that the person who lost it must have left it on top of their car and driven off, forgetting it.  I used facebook to search for the name I found several that matched, I sent the most likely my number asking them to call me if they were missing a wallet. I got a call back 15min later, not want to hand the wallet over to the wrong person I asked them if they could just tell me some details about the wallet and its contents so I was certain it was hers. After a few questions I told I would meet her at the same Z. When she got there she gave me $20 as a reward which I was relucent to take but did. I she glad I found her wallet and helped took the time to find her.</p>
        <h1>My culture and My People </h1>
        <h2 class="s-text"> Being different with different People</h2>
        <p>I am fijian indian who came immagrated to nz when  I was very young. Within my culture It was imporant to practices religion and speak hindi while home so not to lose my roots. Someone who influence me was my father for obivious reasons, it was aginst my religion to eat beef but he didnt eat pork out of habit, this was something I adopted as well, however this cause alot of friction between me and other as whenever I would go out I won't eat any of the meats as they would usually be pork or deef. It would start small fights as to why I could just eat pork or how it was really a sacrifice when I still ate other meats like chicken and fish, however I never made a fuss about it and simply ate stuff that wasn't meat when it became an issue. My father never pushed me to not eat pork, he simply never ate it himself, when I asked him why he told he his reason. As pork was meat I would not eat normally it became a habit and while I known why the meat is delicous (no-one can argue bacon isn't delicious) as I got older and meet more people with different relgious values I saw how annoying and aggravating it was when they tried to push their views onto other. I noticed that people were more inclined to speak to me about food and food-taboos becasue I never judged them for what they eat or took offense when they brought it up. My friends were from different backgrounds but I kept the same ones I was friends with from elementary school, this did show me that the people who care about you will be you friend no matter the distance or place, many of my friends move out of Auckland or NZ altogether however the still make the effort to stay in contact. That shapes my values more than anything, when you care you make the effort.</p>
        <h1>Evaluate your limitations</h1>
        <h2 class="s-text">Forcus and fustration</h2>
        <p>My limitation is my inabilite to focus on sometihng for long period of time outside of a class room or structured enviroment. While I enjoy problem solving a solution to issue I need to have a basic understanding of that problem to try to fix it. I become discorgued greatly when I am unable to fix an issue that I do not even understand the issue to. </p>
        <p>This problem is admittedly self perpetuating as If i don't try to focus in on something I will not spend the time or engry to gain the knowledge to fix that issue meaning I will be less likely to more on it more making the problem worse.</p>
