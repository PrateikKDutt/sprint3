<h1 class="text-large"> Learning Plan Of Prateik</h1>

      <h1 class="n-text bl"> "1.What is your long term goal or career pathway?"</h1>
      <p class="box">My long term goal is to eventully get a programming job that can be done remotely and have the understanding to solve problems when I come across them.</p>
  

      <h1 class="n-text">2.A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h1>
<p>I can understand complex problems quickly but have a hard time forcing on sometihng for long periods of time. I am good at speaking to people and contributing to ideas like brainstorming solutions however I can get bogged down in detial, I feel like I need to understand every part of an issue before solving it but can slow me down and cause issues when a multipe solutions don't work </p>


  
     <h1 class="n-text">3.What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>
<p>I would like to developed the skill to listen better to other and commuincate better with other people, I hope to get better at learning outside of a class-room</p>

    <h1 class="n-text">4.A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h1>
<p>I am trying to take my work at 30min periods at a time. I enjoy the structure for going to a class and learning </p>


    <h1 class="n-text">5.A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>
  <p>I will contact my friend who has gone thought Deve-academy before if I am really stuck or more likey simply message one of the Facilitation team if I really need help. I will try to give myself as much marge of error for this as possible.</p>

<h1 class="n-text">6.A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h1>
  <p>I simply expect them answer my questions about the script and to listen to me if I need to explain an issue or problem politely as long as I am polite and respectly in return</p>    


<h1 class="n-text"> 7.Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h1>
  <p>I have kept my time very open spefically for studying this year as I want to earn java-script, However I have suffered a family issue that will complicate things moving forward. I do not see how I will be able to accont of this moving forward.</p>
