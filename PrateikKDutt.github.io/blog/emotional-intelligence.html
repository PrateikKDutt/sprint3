      A key part of doing this is being able to speak with yourself In a non-critical manner when not necessary
      You sent
      Well we must all think of ourselves critically at times to improve there is no benefit to Overly criticising yourself
      You sent
      Being able to speak with someone about how you’re feeling Can be a great way to help sympathise with other people and empathise with them it makes me feel less alone when I’m dealing with my emotions and so I feel better about myself
      I have friends that have known me my entire life and they know some of my habits better than I do myself they can help point out when I am being overly critical of myself or one I am being too isolated.
      A part of mindfulness and emotional intelligence is avoiding things that will make you angry or make you sad when you are already in a depressed state it isn’t so much about distracting yourself as it is about trying to give yourself space to process without piling on more negative emotions, it is also a good acknowledgement that no they’re not having complete positive emotions isn’t a bad thing either.

  Motivation is wanting to making changed to better control an emotional state you will be in or how to handle emtional situations and having the will or drive to act rationally or maturely in those situations.
  Empathy is  trying to see the perspective of the other person and trying to feel as how  you would feel in their  place because you have the self-awareness you have an idea of how you would react and help you feel what it would be like in their place, or how you react with their situation hopefully make you more empathetic towards others it would be easier to communicate with them
  Social skills or the social communication aspect of emotional intelligence is knowing how to say something or how to act when someone is with in a specific emotional mood or avoid acting in a certain way that  will Likely cause less offence and makes a brother person more receptive to whatever you’re trying to say or vice versa make you more respective to them
   Self-regulation is taking actions or performing techniques to help either calm yourself down or channel your emotional state into a more productive and healthier manner, these message may be breathing exercises leaving an area or speaking calmly at two and a angry person and hopefully deescalating a situation or leaving a situation before you escalate it further self-regulation can often help with the communication and lead to better self-awareness</p>
