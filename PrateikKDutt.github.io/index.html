<p>My blog on emtional intelligence, I must admit I found this is to be easier. Emtional Intelligence is something that I have study before and was a part of my school life. I have not be afriad of talking about emtion and find talking about my feeling to be a good way to help me process it. While I can't say that I'm a master or that I can practise everyday I do known what they are and the best ones of me to do.</p>
